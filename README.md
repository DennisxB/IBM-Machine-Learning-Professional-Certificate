## Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning

############################

## Supervised Learning: Regression

I used regression models to predict house sale prices based on the information regarding the demography (income, population, house occupancy) in the districts, the location of the districts (latitude, longitude), and general information regarding the house in the districts (number of rooms, number of bedrooms, age of the house).

## Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning

The challenge is to help the company analyze all relevant customer data to develop focused customer retention programs based on the telco customer churn dataset.

## Supervised Learning: Regression

I used regression models to predict house sale prices based on the information regarding the demography (income, population, house occupancy) in the districts, the location of the districts (latitude, longitude), and general information regarding the house in the districts (number of rooms, number of bedrooms, age of the house).

## Supervised Learning: Classification
 
The goal of this project is to create Classification models that will predict which class the flower 
is, based on petal and sepal sizes and the models are going to be evaluated based on 
their Predictability. 

## Unsupervised Learning

############################

## Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning
Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company's product or service during a certain time frame. The objective is to figure out why a customer leaves and when they leave with reasonable accuracy, it would immensely help the organization to strategize their retention initiatives manifold.

## Specialized Models: Time Series and Survival Analysis
The main objective of the project is to build a time series model that will be 
able to forecast the climate for the next 12 months. We will be using the 
LSTM method to find the most accurate model.
